# CS541-Project
## Comparison of Ant Colony Optimization and Genetic Algorithm for solving Traveling Salesman Problem

### Steps to Run
1) Download the repository to local machine.
2) Run **"main.py"** file.
3) Every time a test case is finished a graph is generated, close the graph to continue the remaining test cases.
4) Final graph of ACO vs GA is generated which marsks the end of the code.
5) You can also avoid displaying graph after each test case, this can be done by setting **"show_graphs=False"** in the line 75 of the code.
6) Ideal case to check for higher accuracy set the **NUMBER_OF_TESTS** variable to 30, 50, etc, but to run for short period of time set it to 3 and you can see various graphs.
